# Miscellaneous Notes

## Instantiating applications

### EC2

- Golden AMI: install applications into an image, launch EC2 instances quickly from AMI
- Dynamic config with User Data scripts, so hybrid of Golden EMI and User Data

### RDS

- Restore from snapshot, schemas and data ready

### EBS 

- Restore from snapshot, formatted, data ready
