# Amazon MQ Notes

- While SQS, SNS are cloud-native proprietary messaging services, Amazon MQ support open protocols that your existing on-premises apps might use

For: 
- RabbitMQ
- ActiveMQ

Doesn't scale as much as SQS/SNS, but can have Multi AZ with failover

Can have queue feature like SQS and topic features like SNS 

Can use EFS for shared storage between active MQ and standby MQ while will become active during a failover
